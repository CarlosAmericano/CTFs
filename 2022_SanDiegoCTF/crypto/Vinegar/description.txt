My friend gave me another encrypted flag...I think they hate me! I heard them yell something about “Vinegar”, but I still don’t know what they’re talking about!

My friend also yelled something about “preventing plaintext attacks” and said once I’ve decrypted this, I’ll need to append sdctf to the front of it.
