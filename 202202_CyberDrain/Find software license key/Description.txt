For this challenge you'll need the **Workstation-02** virtual lab. 
Mr Al Ghul paid for a license of \"The league of shadows communicator\" and would like his license to be retrieved. 
He remembers that he is only able to use the application logged in under the \"Ras\" user.
The recovered files from the machine are in c:\\Recovered Files on Workstation-02. The flag is the license key.",
