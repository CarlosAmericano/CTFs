Elf Holly is suspicious of Elf-ministrator and wants to get onto the root account of a server he setup to see what files are on his account. The problem is, Holly is a low-privileged user.. can you escalate her privileges and hack your way into the root account?

Deploy and SSH into the machine.
Username: holly
Password: tuD@4vt0G*TU

SSH is not running on the standard port.. You might need to nmap scan the machine to find which port SSH is running on.
nmap <machine_ip> -p <start_port>-<end_port>
