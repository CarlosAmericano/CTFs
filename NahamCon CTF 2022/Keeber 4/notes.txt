Next, clone the latest version of JtR from the GIT repo and build it

[user]~$ cd ~/Documents/crackpass
[user]~$ git clone git://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper -b bleeding-jumbo john 
[user]~$ cd  john/src
[user]~$ ./configure && make -s clean && make -sj4
Install tab completion

[user]~$ sudo make shell-completion
Now test your build. This took about 5 minutes on my machines

[user]~$ cd ~/Documents/crackpass/john/run
[user]~$ ./john --test=0
JtR test And (optionally) benchmark the build. Note that this can take 25+ minutes and is NOT required

[user]~$ ./john --test
Installing HashCat
Some Linux instilations come with hashcat built in or a version you can download with apt-get. But, hashcat recommends compiling from their github, so that's what we're going to do.
